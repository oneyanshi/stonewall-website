	<h3><center><i>GAY: THE FIRST WEEKLY GAY NEWSPAPER</i></h3></center>
	<p> 
		Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke, described as "witty, wise, straightforward, and <i>pretty</i>,"  wrote the column "Homosexual Citizen" under a pseudonym for a vulgar newspaper called <i>Screw</i> (Streitmatter 242). The couple wrote articles often described as "upbeat" and "positive." They often focused on accomplishments of the gay community and of more positive news of the community, e.g. the opening of the first gay bookstore in the country. Their column gave the straight audience of <i>Screw</i> a new perspective on the gay community, i.e. a positive one. Because <i>Screw</i> was widely read by about 150,000 people, their column got plenty of exposure. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		Five months after the Stonewall riots, Nichols and Clarke began to edit their own weekly newspaper, <i>GAY</i> while still writing the column "The Homosexual Citizen." Each issue featured a handsome man on the front page, and in response to arrest at a pornopgrahic bookstore, the editors took a risk and photogaphed an employee, Rick Nielsen, nude. Nielsen's seductive smile and his genitalia graced the front page of the newspaper. 

	</p> 
	<p> 
		<i>GAY</i> was financed by the creator of <i>Screw</i>, Al Goldstein. He footed the bill and distributed the newspaper while Nichols and Clarke provided the content. The newspaper was funny, vibrant, unapologetic, and liberating. They set the tone for the new era of LGBT+ press. 
	</p>  
	<p> 
		The energy after the Stonewall Riots exploded. People were riding on the new energy waves of gay liberation. The newspaper benefitted from that and it became widely popular with a circulation of about 25,000 people. <i>GAY</i> was considered a moderate publication and it was not one that advocated for violence. Nichols and Clarke believed that the root of homophobia was ignorance, and they wanted to educate, not harm. They covered stories and endorsed "kiss-ins" and "dance-ins," during which same-sex couples would engage in public displays of affection. They covered the first Gay Pride Parade as well. They endorsed politicians who supported gay rights and encouraged the LGBT+ community to go and vote. Furthermore, the newspaper concerned itself with laws and how they affected the gay community.
