		Jerry Lisker, writer for the <i>The New York Daily News</i>, published an 
		article on July 6th, 1969, that painted an unfair image of the patrons of 
		the Stonewall Inn and of the Stonewall Riots. Lisker described the scene 
		during the riots as, "...Queen Power exploded with all the fury of a gay atomic
		bomb. Queens, princesses, and ladies-in-waiting began hulring anything they 
		could get their polished, manicured fingernails on." Their weapons were "femme
		fatale missiles." In general, Lisker's description made the riots seem ludicrious.

		However, his sentiments were echoed in other mainstream news articles at the time 
		as well, many scolding the rioters for putting up arrest with the police and for 
		their lifestyle. To see the article, click on the image to the left.
