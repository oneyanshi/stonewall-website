	<h3><center>WHAT HAPPENED?</h3></center>
	<p> 
		
		In the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, police raided the 
		Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in the Greenwich Village section of
		New York City. In an era where homosexuality was seen as a mental illness and
		was considered illegal in all the states but Illinois, police raids on gay bars 
		and clubs were not out of the norm. Most raids were settled peacefully. 
		
	</p> 
	<p> 	
		But this raid was different.  
		
	</p> 
	<p> 
		
		People fought back the police in narrow streets, resulting in riots that lasted for nearly a week. Patrons 
		resisted arrest and police armed themselves with riot gear and 
		beating sticks. Mainstream newspapers like the <i>New York Daily News</i> 
		wrote articles that ridiculed LGBT+ community. However, Stonewall 
		encouraged other publications to rise, "to come out of the closet," and defend the community, giving 
		them a call to action.
