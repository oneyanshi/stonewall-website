		Other publications of the time were newspapers like <i>Gay Sunshine</i>, <i>Gay Times</i>, and <i>Killer Dyke</i> voiced radical viewpoints. <i>Gay Sunshine</i> outright targetted heterosexuals and much of their illustrations drew inspiration from publications from The Black Panthers. They were a defiant voice that sought change through radical means. <i>Gay Times</i> endorsed violence through its logo and was a one-sheet newsletter that the editor, John O'Brien, taped to trees and utility poles (Streitmatter, 246). Finally, <i>Killer Dyke</i>, a miliant feminist lesbian focused tabloid centered in Chicago advocated for violence as well through writing and provoking images.

		A publication that is argurably the oldest LGBT+ magazine, "The Advocate," founded in 1967, was created prior to The Stonewall and is ongoing today. They reported on the Stonewall riots and championed the rights of LGBT+ community. Much like <i>GAY</i>, "The Advocate" promoted non-violence and sought education of American society versus dismantling the American society.
