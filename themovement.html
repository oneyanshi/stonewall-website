	<h3><center>THE MOVEMENT</h3></center>
	<p> 
		Much of the dissident press that rose up from the ground as a response to the Stonewall Riots were short lived, lasting up until 1972. However, the energy that resulted from the Stonewall Riots and the newspaper continue on to this day. The dissident media was the nourishment for the beginnings of a modern LGBT+ rights movement; it provided the ground for where the movement's ideologies took root. 

	</p> 
	<p> 
		Since 1969 and the Stonewall Riots, the LGBT+ community has seen significant improvement in how those in the community are treated politically and socially. Mainstream media is slowly incporating LGBT+ characters in TV shows in a more positive light. Gay characters began to appear on TV in 1970, beginning with Will from "Will & Grace." Within just two years of the Stonewall Riots, nearly every state had an LGBT+ advocacy group established. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		The movement itself became mainstream as activists shifted towards a more moderate perspective. Those part of the LGBT+ community slowly came out of the closet, e.g. famous host, Ellen DeGeneres. Acceptance did not come immediately but gradually. The shift in writing went from angry and outraged to writing about news about the community and celebration of the lifestyle. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		The mainstream news media slowly began to fight for LGBT+ rights, covering their stories and documenting their fight and movements towards a better life. They covered the battle for AIDs, the treatment of LGBT+ people in the workplace and in the military, same-sex marriage, legal issues of unions, and more recently, transgender rights. Without the mainstream media, progress would've been slower. 

		The modern LGBT+ rights movement have hit several milestones in the past decades: homosexuality was removed from the American Pyschiatric Association's list of mental illnesses in 1973, the policy "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was repealed in 2010, and same-sex marriage was legalized across the nation in the summer of 2015. While there are setbacks, there is also progress. Like activists and dissident writers in the Gay and Lesbian Liberation movement of the past, activists and writers of today's LGBT+ rights movement are still divided among themselves of what issues to focus on and how to view particular persons in the community, e.g. drag queens and transgender people. However, many will agree that the community must concern itself with politics, health, and equal rights.
