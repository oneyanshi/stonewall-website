	<h3><center>THE IMPORTANCE OF STONEWALL</h3></center>
	<p> 
		Daivd Carter in his book, <i>Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution</i>, explained to readers the importance of Stonewall and what it meant for the modern LGBT+ movement. While there were riots prior to Stonewall, none of them met the criteria for nation-wide recognition and coverage. Carter notes this in his book, in the last chapter of his book as he comes to his conclusions. 

	</p>
	<p> 
		According to Carter, Greenwich Village at the time was both the best-known gay community in America and the place where homosexuality was aggressively policed. It took place in the nation's media capital, where <i>The Village Voice</i>, the country's leading alternative newspaper was nearly a block away (though their coverage was disdainful of the Stonewall Riots). Furthermore, New York had the highest concentration of the LGBT+ community--combined with geographic, political, social, economical reasons, the riots rung in a new era in which the LGBT+ community was going to be loud and proud, so to speak. 

		Carter quotes Morty Manford, then president of Gay Activists Alliance, founded in New York City on December 21st, 1969, in saying that "the true legacy of the Stonewall Riots is the ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality.... it is now a worldwide movement that has won many significant victories, most of them flowing from those six days in the summer of 1969 when gay people found the courage to stand up for themselves on the streets of Greenwich Village" (Carter 266).

	<p> 
		However, that isn't to say that people should ignore the "Stonewalls" prior to the riots in 1969. 

	</p> 
	<p>
		Three years ago, 1966, in California's Tenderloin was a 24-hour cafeteria called Gene Compton's cafeteria. The cafeteria was an intersection of "drag queens, trans women, and gay hustlers" (NPR). The Tenderloin was one of the few places of refuge for the LGBT+ community, yet they were still subject to police harrasment and mistreatment by the general public. The riots, much like the riots in New York, were led by trans people of color. However, the violent story of the Compton cafeteria goes unnoticed in history.  According to historian Susan Stryker, "It was the first known instance of collective militant queer resistance to police harrassment in United States history" (NPR). After the riot, activists established the first peer-run support and advocacy organization in the world, the National Transsexual Counseling Unit.
	</p> 
	<p> 
		Compton's cafeteria is not the only story that is obscured by history, and there are several factors in play--particularly with the media, as such stories were reported locally but not nationally. While Stonewall is whitewashed (many forget that the riots were led by black drag queens, yet the memorial across the street depicts two white gay men and two white lesbians), its impact on the modern LGBT+ revolution continues even today.
