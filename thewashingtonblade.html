	<h3><center>THE WASHINGTON BLADE</h3></center>
	<p> 
		
		In October 1969, four months after the Stonewall Riots in New York City, 'The Gay Blade' was established in Washington D.C., covering 
		news in the LGBT community and championing LGBT rights. It is known 
		as the "publication record of the gay community," as it covers news
		locally, nationally, and internationally. 

	</p>
	<p> 
		It has gone through many name changes since it's inception, from 
		'The Gay Blade' to 'DC Agenda' to finally 'The Washington Blade.' 
		At the time of its creation, it was only a one-page, black/white 
		community newsletter. Its goals were to bring the gay community together and for people to be better informed. It is one of the oldest LGBT+ publications today. It has grown significantly from 
		the time the publication began and now. The first issues were 
		written by volunteers and two editors, Nancy Tucker and Bart Wenger. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		When 'The Gay Blade' expanded and became multi-paged, it soon began to shift its efforts from bringing the community together to gathering news for the gay community and of the gay community. The publication, of course, wasn't without any controversy. Some felt that the paper was too white-washed and did not represent the city well enough. As a result, some groups formed to create a publication in response and to compete with 'The Gay Blade.' 
	</p> 
	<p> 
		Now as 'The Washington Blade,' the publication still reports on the LGBT+ community both in print and online at <a href="http://washingtonblade.com" target="_blank">The Washington Blade.</a> Click on the picture to the left to view the first newsletter published by 'The Washington Blade.'
