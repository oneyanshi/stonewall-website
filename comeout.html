	<h3><center><i>COME OUT!: THE RADICAL NEWSPAPER</i></h3></center>
	<p> 
		
		<i>Come Out!</i> was the publication of a group called the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), which can be described as the equivalent of the Black Panters of the Civil Rights Movement. GLF was established immediately afer the Stonewall Riots in 1969. Not only were the activists fueled by the aftermath of the Stonewall Riots, many were inflamed by the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. <i>Come Out!</i> rejected the current American society and demanded not only gay rights but the complete overhaul of American society. They did not follow journalistic standards, and the papers were riddled with typos and contained colorful language.

		The content of the newspaper varied from personal essays to letters to reviews of books, records, films, and news article. Sometimes there were illustrations of homoerotic drawings and photos. The publication lacked structure in their staff, claiming that having structure and paying their staff meant they were buying into the "capitalistic, heterosexual society that was at the root of all their problems" (Streitmatter 244). They called for the boycott of any estsablishment owned by a heterosexual, including the Stonewall Inn and the newspaper <i>GAY</i> (Al Goldstein was straight). 

	</p> 
		Compared to their rival, <i>GAY</i>, <i>Come Out!</i> was siginificantly different. They were considered "radical" and extremely "left." The publication advocated for acts of violence in issue one, calling for action from the gay community. They criticized the Mafia in an attack campaign as they had a stronghold on many of the gay bars and hangout locales. The publication lasted until 1972, going under due to dissident voices within the organiziation itself.
